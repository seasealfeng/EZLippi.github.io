**Rembrandts - I'll Be There For You**

So no one told you life was gonna be this way. 

Your job's a joke.You're broke.

Your love life's D.O.A.

It's like you're always stuck in second gear.

When it hasn't been your day. your week your month or even your year,

But,

I'll be there for you (When the rain starts to pour)

I'll be there for you (Like I've been there before)

I'll be there for you ('Cause you're there for me too)

You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight.

You burned your breakfast.

So far, things are going great.

Your mother warned you there'd be days like these.

But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees.

And,

I'll be there for you (When the rain starts to pour)

I'll be there for you (Like I've been there before)

I'll be there for you ('Cause you're there for me too)

仅以这首歌献给我亲爱的初入上海的懵懂小姐。假如生活并不能如你所愿，无论未来的日子会怎样，我们两个都要好好的在一起。

算起来这已经是我们在一起的第七个年头，两个人也算是都要踏入社会了。我们两个都是比较爱玩的人，也都比较浮躁（当然你比我好点）。日子慢慢过起来之后，希望我们都能慢慢改掉浮躁小家子气的脾气，培养为人妻为人夫（当然会有为人父）的心性。

就当是写在未来日子之前的寄语。

**爱人，你可感到明天已经来临**

**码头上停着我们的船**

**我会洗干净头发爬上桅杆**

**撑起我们葡萄枝嫩叶般的家**
